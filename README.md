# Week 1 - Triangle Pattern Generator

This project prints three different types of triangle patterns using the `"*"` character in Python. It is part of the Week 1 learning module to get hands-on experience with basic Python syntax, loops, and string formatting.

## Patterns Implemented

1. **Lower Triangular Pattern**

2. **Upper Triangular Pattern**

3. **Pyramid Pattern**

# Week 2 - Singly Linked List Implementation in Python
This project implements a singly linked list in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to create a linked list, append elements, print the list, and delete the Nth node with appropriate error handling.

It is part of the Week 2 learning module to build a strong foundation in data structures and understand how nodes are linked dynamically in memory.

# Features Implemented
Node Class: Represents a single node in the list.

LinkedList Class: Manages the list operations including:

Append Node – Adds a new node to the end of the list.

Print List – Displays the list elements in order.

Delete Nth Node – Deletes the node at the given 1-based index with exception handling.

Exception Handling
Deleting from an empty list

Deleting with an invalid index (e.g., negative or out of range)

File Structure
bash
Copy

Sample Output
Initial list:
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> None
Deleting node at position 3 with value 30
List after deleting 3rd node:
10 -> 20 -> 40 -> 50 -> None
Error: Index out of range.
Error: Cannot delete from an empty list.

# Week 3 – Sales Data Analysis & Visualization 📊

This project performs **data analysis and visualization** on a sales dataset using **Python**, with the help of libraries like **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.

## 📁 Dataset Source

The dataset is obtained from IBM's sample datasets:
[Sales Products Sample Data – IBM](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/sales-products-sample-data/)

## 🎯 Objective

- Read the dataset from a CSV file and create a Pandas DataFrame.
- Use `.describe()` and `.info()` to get descriptive statistics and structure.
- Analyze how much **revenue** is being generated by each product.
- Use `groupby()` to:
  - Display all products
  - Sum their revenue
- Create the following visualizations:
  - 📊 **Bar Graph** of **Product Line** vs. Mean Revenue
  - 📊 **Bar Graph** of **Product Type** vs. Mean Quantity
  - 📈 Sales breakdown by category
  - 📊 Bar and 🥧 Pie Charts of:
    - Product Line
    - Product Type
    - Quantity
